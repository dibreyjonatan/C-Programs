## Limitations encountered

I couldnot write down a makefile that would create c objects to compile the code.
It gives me a segmentation fault 

# CMAKE

I decided to automate the production of the makefile using CMAKE.
WIth CMAKE, i had to add the math library which is a static library with symbol m.
The makefile was successful and could create objects and final binary through cmake.
